// TODO:
// Serial Interface - Needs to be initialized
// Temeperature Sensor - Needs to be initialized, periodically poll sensor, store temperature in variable, print out to serial monitor.
// IMU - Needs to be initialized, periodically poll sensor, store Z-axis angle in variable, take initial value as 0 deg print out to serial monitor.
// Sitr Bar Motor - Needs to be initialized, just constantly turn at 80% speed for now, we'll tune speed later.
// Servo Motor - Needs to be initialized, turn 180 deg clockwise once at start to dump reactants, wait 1 sec to finish dumping, turn back 180 deg counter-clockwise to return to upright position, set speed to 100% for now, tune later.
// MicroSD Card - Store all variable data to MicroSD Card on microcontroller.
